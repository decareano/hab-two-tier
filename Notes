this exercise fails here: 
sudo docker-compose -p habquickstart up -d    //at this point it gets error: incorrect format, cannot start the docker daemon
Point is: you cannot launch the containers 
also, of interest: original error was: sudo requires a password, please configure it. 
coderanger in SO: This usually means somewhere in a cookbook you are testing, 
you are changing the sudoers config such that the kitchen user doesn't have nopasswd sudo. You need to either 
not do that, or when running under Test Kitchen make sure you re-create the entry for the kitchen user.
